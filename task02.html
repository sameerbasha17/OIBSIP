                    Swami Vivekananda, born as Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Kolkata, India. He was a great spiritual leader, philosopher, and reformer. 
                    From an early age, he displayed deep spiritual insight and a strong intellect. Under the guidance of his guru Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, 
                    he realized the unity of all religions and the importance of selfless service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vivekananda's early life was deeply influenced by his mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, who instilled in him values of devotion and discipline. 
                    His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a lawyer, which gave him exposure to Western education and rational thinking. 
                    As a young boy, Narendra was energetic and inquisitive, deeply interested in spirituality and philosophy. 
                    He studied extensively and mastered various subjects, including Hindu scriptures like the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita, as well as Western philosophy and science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His spiritual journey took a turning point when he met Sri Ramakrishna at the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. 
                    Under Ramakrishna’s guidance, Narendra realized the concept of Advaita Vedanta, emphasizing the unity of all existence. 
                    The untimely death of Ramakrishna in 1886 left a profound impact on Vivekananda, and he, along with his disciples, 
                    took monastic vows and formed the Ramakrishna Order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1893, he traveled to the United States and participated in the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago. 
                    His iconic speech, where he addressed the audience as "Sisters and Brothers of America," captivated the Western world, earning him immense respect. 
                    He introduced Hindu philosophy, yoga, and Vedanta to the West and spent several years spreading spiritual knowledge across the United States and Europe.
